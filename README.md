Orc Battle
==============
This is an implementation of the Orc Battle game from Land Of Lisp written in Clojure.

I have three goals for this project:
1. Rewrite the CL version in Clojure with a more functional approach (along with a write up of the differences and challenges).
2. Expand the game play
3. Implement a web front end.
